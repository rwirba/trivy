Subject: âœ… Trivy Offline Vulnerability Scanning â€“ Setup & Workflow

Team,

We now have a working offline vulnerability scanning process with Trivy integrated into our environment. This setup allows us to reliably scan Podman images on our air-gapped RHEL servers, generate structured vulnerability reports, and visualize them in a dashboard for weekly tracking.

ðŸ”§ Setup Overview
Online Build Server (Ubuntu/MacBook/Windows)

Runs a script that builds the latest Trivy offline DB bundle (trivy-offline.db.tgz).

The DB includes both OS vulnerabilities and language package advisories.

Output bundle contains:

trivy.db

metadata.json

Air-gapped RHEL Server

Receives the offline DB tarball via Ansible automation.

DB is unpacked into ~/.cache/trivy/db/.

Local images are built/stored with Podman and scanned using the offline DB.

Bulk Scanning Script

Discovers all Podman images on the server.

Runs Trivy in offline archive mode (reliable even without Podman socket).

Generates JSON reports into timestamped folders:

bash
Copy
Edit
./trivy-reports-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS/*.json
ðŸ“Š Dashboard & Reporting
Reports can be uploaded to the Trivy Dashboard HTML viewer.

Provides:

Weekly trend of vulnerabilities across all images.

Per-image severity breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unknown).

Drill-down vulnerabilities viewer with filters (CVE, package, fix availability).

Export options available:

weekly_summary.csv

latest_week_per_image.csv

vulnerabilities_filtered.csv

ðŸš€ Functionality Highlights
Offline compatible â†’ no need for internet access on RHEL servers.

Configurable severity â†’ default includes all severities, but can be limited (e.g., HIGH,CRITICAL).

Supports both OS & language packages (or OS-only for smaller DB size).

Automated workflow with Ansible for syncing DB and triggering scans.

Scalable â†’ works for any number of Podman images.

âœ… Next Steps
Use the automation playbook to regularly update the DB and run scans.

Review results in the HTML dashboard or CSV exports.

Begin remediation by prioritizing Critical/High vulnerabilities.

Future options: integrate into CI/CD or centralize reports for multi-host aggregation.

This gives us a repeatable, air-gap-friendly vulnerability management pipeline. Please start using the workflow on your projects and share any issues or improvement suggestions.

Thanks,
